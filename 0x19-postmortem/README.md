# Web Stack Debugging - Postmortem Report

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a web stack issue, particularly focusing on an outage that has occurred or could potentially occur. The goal is to create a postmortem report that thoroughly documents the incident, from detection to resolution, and provides insights on how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Requirements

Your postmortem report must include the following sections:

### 1. Issue Summary
- **Duration of the Outage**: Clearly specify the start and end times of the outage, including the timezone.
- **Impact**: Describe what services were down or slow, the user experience during the outage, and the percentage of users affected.
- **Root Cause**: Provide a brief explanation of what caused the outage.

### 2. Timeline
- Provide a bullet-point timeline of the incident, including:
  - When and how the issue was detected (monitoring alert, engineer observation, customer complaint).
  - Actions taken to investigate the problem and assumptions made about the root cause.
  - Misleading paths or debugging steps that were explored.
  - Individuals or teams the incident was escalated to.
  - How the incident was finally resolved.

### 3. Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: Detail the exact cause of the issue, explaining the technical specifics.
- **Resolution**: Explain the steps taken to fix the issue and restore service.

### 4. Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements**: List the areas that can be improved or fixed to prevent future outages.
- **Tasks**: Provide a specific list of tasks, such as patching servers, adding monitoring, or updating documentation, to ensure the issue doesn't reoccur.
